* org-outline-numbering
This package defines a minor mode that displays an outline numbering as overlays on Org mode headlines. The numbering matches how it would appear when exporting the org file.

Activating ~org-outline-numbering-mode~ displays the numbers and deactivating it clears them. There is no facility for auto-updating but the numbering can be recalculated by calling ~org-outline-numbering-display~ and cleared by calling ~org-outline-numbering-clear~.

By default trees that are commented, archived, tagged noexport or other similar things that would exclude them from org export donâ€™t get a number to keep consistency with exports. If additional tags are to be excluded from numbering they can be added to ~org-outline-numbering-ignored-tags~.

** A note about efficiency
The outline numbers is determined by parsing the entire buffer (with ~org-element-parse-buffer~). This is obviously not very efficient and can be slow for large buffers, but is currently the simplest way to get a correctly numbered tree.
