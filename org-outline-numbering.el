;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines a minor mode that displays an outline
;; numbering as overlays on Org mode headlines. The numbering matches
;; how it would appear when exporting the org file.

;; Activating ‘org-outline-numbering-mode’ displays the numbers and
;; deactivating it clears them. There is no facility for auto-updating
;; but the numbering can be recalculated by calling
;; ‘org-outline-numbering-display’ and cleared by calling
;; ‘org-outline-numbering-clear’.

;; By default trees that are commented, archived, tagged noexport or
;; other similar things that would exclude them from org export don’t
;; get a number to keep consistency with exports. If additional tags
;; are to be excluded from numbering they can be added to
;; ‘org-outline-numbering-ignored-tags’.
